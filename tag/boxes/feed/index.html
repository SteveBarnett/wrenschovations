<p>So, Monday night was a bit odd.<br />
Cold, boxy, slightly miserable, actually.</p>
<p>Tuesday day was better.<br />
Much better.<br />
We now have a shower*, a <a href="http://www.water-rhapsody.co.za/">Garden Rhapsody</a>** (thanks, Jeremy!).<br />
We also have bookshelves full of books again, a little workstation with printer and stuff again, an entertainment stuff area*** and a painting or two up on the walls.</p>
<p>Everything is kind of temporary (wrong place, on the wrong thing, etc.) but it feels nice.<br />
It&#8217;s looking like our house now, not like a house with all our boxes in.</p>
<p>Big Thing to do tonight is unpack the kitchen.<br />
We&#8217;ve been waiting for the floors to dry before throwing heavy machinery and workbenches on it.<br />
Yesterday it was almost ready, but not quite.<br />
Given how important food is to our lives it&#8217;s been quite odd being without food making ability for so long&#8230;<br />
Having the cooker back in place will make a big difference to our Life&#8217;s tyle.<br />
Ahem.</p>
<p>_____________________________</p>
<p>* &#8211; pics to follow. Installed by a classic German. He was horrified at the slant of bits of wall &#8211; millimetres out! also, we can&#8217;t use it until tonight &#8211; drying the sticky bits.<br />
** &#8211; which we will obviously appreciate more in summer.<br />
*** &#8211;  so we can veg tonight. we needs it, precious.</p>
