You do realise that builders are a noxiously inventive race, and will find ways to trample all over bits of the garden you would have thought they&#039;d have no reason to go anywhere near? The newly-planted side and front bits look luvverly, which means it&#039;s practically certain they&#039;re about to be the recipient of planks, loads of gravel and great big elephantine builder feet. I suggest you issue the cats with electric cattle-prods and pictures of builders for pattern recognition.]]></description>
