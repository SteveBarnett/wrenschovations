		<description><![CDATA[Thank you :-) .

Ze Var, ja, Ze Poolen, not yet...
Only when they&#039;re at the Point Of No Return.
Under-your-breath mumblings acceptable, though.

(Re blue: there&#039;s a definite sci-fi kinda feel that particular shade of blue... re files: yay! thanks! we shall snaffle shortly...)

		<description><![CDATA[Yay! Congrats! Are we allowed to Mention Ze Var now??

(I think the blue lights are pretty. But then I&#039;ve been watching a lot of X-Files. Onto Season 9 as of last night, btw, so tell me when you want 8).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[lol - that is quite amusing. LED (i am assuming that they are LED lights) only come in two colours...blue and white. 

Guess that after all that it was inevitable...

It does look cool though and should be quite attractive once the deck it on.]]></description>
