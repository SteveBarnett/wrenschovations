		<description><![CDATA[Hello there!

We believe it to be a Mexican Hat Plant, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.za/images?q=mexican+hat+plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Goggle image search&lt;/a&gt; seems to confirm this.
Good luck finding one - they are awesome.

		<description><![CDATA[Random question here, but what is the name of that plant you have that grows the baby plants on the edges of it&#039;s leaves? I used to have one, but it out grew my parent&#039;s kitchen and they gave it away. I would like to find another, but I don&#039;t know what it is called to ask for it in any flower shops. 
Your help would be much appreciated :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!
Yep, all in the garden.
Except, alas, the miracle tree which is currently just a stump (snapped in strong winds).

Once the rains let up a bit I shall attempt to snap a wide shot - it&#039;s very, very, green at the moment!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What lovely plants.  I&#039;m particularly impressed by the frangipani, the miracle tree and the bench bought by Eck.  They are beautiful.  Are these all in your garden?  Do you have some full garden shots, so we can see the full decor in action?]]></description>
